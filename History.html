<p> The modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician <b>Georg Cantor (1845-1918)</b>. His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897.He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with integers.</p> 
<p>In 1902, the famous <b>English Philosopher Bertand Rusell (1872-1970)</b> showed that the assumptions of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This leads to famous <b> Russell's Paradox</b> .The Russell's Paradox is not only one which rose in set theory.Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians</p>
<p>As a cosequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in by <b> Ernst Zermelo.</b> Another one was proposed by <b> Abraham Fraenkel </b>in 1922. <b> John Von Neumann</b> in 1925 introduced explicity the axiom of regularity.Later in 1937 Paul Berays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation.A modification of these axioms was done by <b> Kurt Godel </b> in his monograph in 1940. This was  known as <b> Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Godel-Bernays (GB)</b> set theory.</p>
<p> Despite all these difficulties,<b> Cantor's set Theory</b> is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are in the set theoretic language.</p>
