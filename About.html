 <p> Set theory is important because it is a theory of integers, models of axiom systems, infinite ordinals, and real numbers, all in one unified structure. This allows it to serve as a foundation for all mathematics, anything about in mathematics can be formalized in set theory naturally and easily, and studing set theory allows us to prove theorems about in mathematics itself.</p>
<p> <font size="8" color="olive">Definition: </font> </p>
<p> A set is well defined collection of objects. The objects of the set are called elements or members of the set. A set is usually denoted by capital letter while its elements are denoted by small letters.</p>
<p><font size="8" color="olive"> Representation of a set:</font></p>

<p> <font size="8" color="olive">Type of Sets </font> </p>
<p> <b><font color="green">\( (i) \) Empty Set</font></b></p>
<p> Empty set is also called a null set or void set. It is denoted by {} or \( \phi \).</p>
<p> <b><font color="green">\( (ii) \) Finite Set</font></b></p>
<p> A set which contains finite number of elements is called a finite set. </p>
<p> <b><font color="green">\( (iii) \) Infinite Set </font></b></p>
<p> A set which is not finite or which contains infinite numbers of elements is called an infinite set.</p> 
<p> <b><font color="green">\( (iv) \) Singleton Set</font></b></p>
<p> A set which contains only one element is called Singleton Set</p>
<p> <b><font color="green">\( (v) \) Equal Set</font></b></p>
<p> Two sets are said to be Equal Sets if they have same elements. </p>
<p> <b><font color="green">\( (vi) \)Equivalent Set</font></b></p>
<p> The two sets A and B are said to be Equivalent Set if \( n(A) =n(B)\).</p>
